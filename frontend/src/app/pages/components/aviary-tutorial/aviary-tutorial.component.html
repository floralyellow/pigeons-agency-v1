    Here you can find your pigeons. Pigeons generate droppings over time. <br>
    You can sell your pigeons to gain <span class="has-text-weight-bold">feathers</span> (needed to level up) <br> <br>
    
    Assign up to 5 pigeon per team (A or B), that will be used to attack other players (pvp), or to launch adventures (pve). <br>
    You can also select which team you want to use for defenses from other players. <br> <br>
    
    Pigeons have 3 main stats during fights: strength :fight: magic & shield. <br>
    Strength pigeons usually have the  highest base values, but strength is diminished by shields. <br>
    Magic pigeons are usually a bit lower than pure strength, but magic is not impacted by shields.. <br>
    Shield pigeons have shield (and a bit of magic).. The shield value is multiplied by the number of opposing strength pigeons. <br>
    Formula : Total strength value +Total magic value - ( opposing shield * number of my strength pigeons)
